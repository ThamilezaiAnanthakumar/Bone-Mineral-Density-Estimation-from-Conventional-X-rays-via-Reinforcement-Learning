# Bone-Mineral-Density-Estimation-from-Conventional-X-rays-via-Reinforcement-Learning
This project aims to develop an AI-powered solution for estimating the T-score, a clinical indicator of bone mineral density (BMD), using conventional X-ray images-offering a cost-effective alternative to DEXA scans.
