# Bone-Mineral-Density-Estimation-from-Conventional-X-rays-via-Reinforcement-Learning

DEXA scans, the gold standard for measuring bone mineral density and T-scores, are **not widely available** in many regions of Sri Lanka and around the world due to their **high cost** and the need for dual X-ray technology.

This project aims to develop an **affordable alternative** by predicting the T-score using **conventional X-ray images**. To achieve this, I employed a **Deep learning** approach where the system **learns**, improving its prediction accuracy over time and making it more intelligent for healthcare applications.

The solution provides valuable support for **orthopedic diagnosis and treatment planning**, especially in areas where advanced equipment is limited.

Additionally, I built a **responsive web application** to enable easy and automatic T-score prediction, improving accessibility and convenience for healthcare providers and patients.
